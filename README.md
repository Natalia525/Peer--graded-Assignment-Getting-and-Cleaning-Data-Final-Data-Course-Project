Code as the view of how performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
